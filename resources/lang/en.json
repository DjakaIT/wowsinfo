  "_wiki_home_description": "World of Warships is a naval action MMO, dipping into the world of large-scale sea battles of the first half of the twentieth century. Epic battles rage across the oceans of the world in order to claim victory among teams comprised of the greatest representatives from the era of multi-ton marine giants. In order to achieve victory in battle, players must employ a wide range of strategies in a variety of tactical decisions. Sudden ambushes, cunning flanking attacks, open confrontation and 'head-on' assaults — captains must strive to find an ideal way to deliver a decisive blow at the enemy. Tactical diversity in World of Warships comes from the inclusion of many different classes of warships, including: aircraft carriers, capable of providing remote air support and striking targets at extreme range; colossal battleships that project power across vast swaths of ocean; light and heavy cruisers with the capability to quickly respond to changing battlefield conditions; and stealthy, agile destroyers which can be highly effective in group attacks.",
  "_wiki_nation_usa_description": "Ships fielded by the United States Navy (USN) sport great armor (albeit in an all-or-nothing design), main battery guns, and anti-aircraft (AA) capabilities, and are less hindered by stock configurations. (Many were built later and subsequently underwent fewer, less drastic changes during service, in contrast to Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) vessels such as Fuso that need to research drastic hull upgrades). Most stock American ships are adequate for their roles, and while fully-upgraded ships perform better, they require little to no change in play style. Early American ship-launched torpedoes do leave a great deal to be desired, but the real strength of USN ships lies in their ability to get into firefights and slug it out, relying on their superior guns and survivability to see them through. The United States inherited many of its nascent naval traditions from the British, from whom it won its independence in 1776. Over the years, the USN encountered various hurdles and successes in its conflicts with the British, French, and Spanish navies, evolving to be a major tool in American diplomacy with the Perry Expedition and President Theodore Roosevelt's 'big stick' foreign policy being notable examples. However, a mix of poor economic outlook, isolationist sentiments, and post-World War I naval disarmament treaties reduced the effectiveness and preparedness of the USN for the Second World War. All of that changed after Japan's 7 December 1941 surprise attack on Pacific Fleet headquarters at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Regarded as an underhanded sneak attack outside the rules of civilized warfare, Pearl Harbor evaporated any reluctance of the American public to go to war. With its battleship fleet crippled by the Pearl Harbor attack, the USN turned to submarines and its fledgling aircraft carrier fleet — the very weapons that the IJN had used in their attempt to neutralize the USN Pacific Fleet — and ironically put them to greater effect than the Japanese (who stuck to battleships and the 'decisive battle' doctrines), achieving successes in the battles of the Coral Sea, Midway, the Philippine Sea, Leyte Gulf, and Okinawa. While slightly behind their IJN counterparts at the onset of the war, the USN gradually caught up both qualitatively and quantitatively; virtually every class of vessel was outfitted with superior fire control equipment such as radar and ballistic computers; the industrial might of the United States produced large numbers of proven designs (the 175 destroyers of the Fletcher class built within the space of less than four years being a prime example) with little unnecessary variation in equipment, so that crew transferred between ships could quickly fill their roles without specialized retraining. The US Navy emerged from World War II as the most powerful navy in the world, a title it still holds to this day.",
  "_wiki_nation_pan_asia_description": "The Pan-Asia faction does not cover a specific nation, but includes ships from various nations within the Asia-Pacific region. Ships from six navies are currently represented in World of Warships: the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan), the Republic of Korea (South Korea), the Republic of Indonesia, the Kingdom of Thailand, and the Federation of Malaysia. In-game, each ship can fly the individual ensign of their respective navy (as shown below) or the Pan-Asian flag (as shown on the left).",
  "_wiki_nation_ussr_description": "With over half her massive landmass bordered by water, Russia's navy was (and still is today) divided into four major fleets: the Pacific, Northern, Baltic and Black Sea Fleets; at the height of the Russian Empire, the Imperial Russian Navy was the fourth most powerful fleet in the world after Great Britain, Spain and France. Lagging technological advancement and disastrous wars greatly dented her power, resulting in mixed performance in the years leading up to World War I; the Northern Fleet was created during the War to protect shipping in the Barents Sea, the Black Sea Fleet distinguished herself against the Ottoman Navy, and the Pacific and Baltic Fleets faded into insignificance following the Russo-Japanese War and the Battle of Tsushima in 1905 respectively. The Imperial Russian Navy suffered a near-complete collapse in the Russian Revolution and the resulting Civil War during the closing years of World War I, and was eventually succeeded by the Soviet Union's Red Fleet. In the years between the World Wars, the rapidly-industrializing Soviet Union (or U.S.S.R.) planned to rebuild the navy, but the Great Purge prevented any meaningful progress, and the Red Fleet would only have a handful of cruisers, obsolete battleships and a reasonable number of destroyers when the U.S.S.R. entered World War II in June 1941 with Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa. However, this did not stop the Red Fleet from performing with distinction: the Baltic Fleet used its sizable submarine fleet to great effect against the Kriegsmarine and the Finnish Navy despite suffering terrible losses themselves; the Naval Aviation service, while not having a single aircraft carrier, sank more ships and crew than any other unit; Russian resourcefulness and tenacity was exemplified by naval guns still being put to use even after extensive damage to individual ships (such as battleship Marat). Thousands of sailors and naval equipment were drafted to reinforce the Red Army as needed, fighting with incredible valor in many significant engagements, including the Battles of Odessa, Sevastopol, Stalingrad, Novorossiysk, and Leningrad. After World War II, the Red Fleet was renamed the Soviet Navy, and went on to play a major role in the Cold War with the United States.",
  "_wiki_nation_europe_description": "The Pan-Europe faction does not cover a specific nation, but includes ships from various nations within the European region. Ships from these navies are currently represented in World of Warships: Sweden, Poland, Greece, Turkey, Norway, Yugoslavia, and Austria-Hungary, with the Netherlands now their own country (since Update 0.10.6) In-game, each ship can fly the individual ensign of their respective navy (as shown below) or the Pan-European flag (as shown on the left).",
  "_wiki_nation_japan_description": "As an island nation, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) was consistently the forefront of Japan's military, characterized by advanced development of naval technology, quality shipbuilding and superb seamanship. Japan also readily looked to and accepted foreign input after the opening of their borders, from the rapid assimilation of foreign technology, to the frequent military exchanges with Dutch, French, British and United States navies, with plenty of naval students being sent to their naval academies and many ships (such as the Kongo) initially being purchased or built in their dockyards while Japan perfected her own shipbuilding capabilities. At the onset of World War II, the IJN was among the few navies who had properly adopted naval aviation and the only navy with fully developed torpedo assets, achieving stunning victories and technological innovations — sweeping successes in the First Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, the Battle of Tsushima giving Japan the distinction of being the first Asian country to have defeated an European power in the modern age, the sinkings of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse, the world's first purpose-built aircraft carrier, the deadly Type 93 'Long Lance' torpedo — and laying down classes of cruisers and destroyers that, despite being much older than their adversaries, remained among the most powerful of their class of any nation during the War. However, several mistakes and oversights during the war resulted in their near-annihilation by the United States Navy. Design flaws — typically the results of cramming as much weaponry as possible into a limited displacement — caused certain ships to be top-heavy and unstable. While concentrating air assets into a single, cohesive force was as effective as it was revolutionary, their carriers were inadequately protected from counterattacks due to lack of radar, faulty design and configuration of anti-aircraft guns, as well as ineffective fire control systems. The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii of 7 December 1941 was a tactical victory but a strategic error, bringing into the war a nation that — while initially under-prepared and as yet unwilling to go to war — had near-limitless resources and unmatched production capabilities. Compounding the error, little to none of the support facilities based in Pearl Harbor — naval repair yards, fuel depots, logistics infrastructure — were attacked, allowing the United States to quickly recover and strike back with a vengeance from their primary naval base in the Pacific. In contrast, Japan did not have the capabilities to replace their losses as quickly, were incredibly dependent on imports — indeed, reducing that dependency was actually one of the major reasons for Japan's expansionist desires — and their unprotected shipping lines due to under-investment in anti-submarine and anti-aircraft warfare allowed the United States Navy to slowly starve Japan into submission. Japanese ships tend to have great variations in design; each class encountered is likely to have noticeably different handling characteristics from the previous tier, a result of the IJN constantly experimenting with or influenced by different designs and doctrines. They boast consistently superior torpedoes, accurate and long-range guns with high alpha damage, and outstanding concealment and mobility; however, they suffer from inferior survivability and anti-aircraft defenses. Their play style is very similar to the 'decisive battle' doctrine that dominated IJN tactics: strike fast and strike hard with precision at targets of importance and/or opportunity, but every hit taken in exchange will be painfully felt.",
  "_wiki_nation_uk_description": "From the early 18th century until the middle of the 20th century, the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom was the most powerful in the world, defeating the French, Dutch and Spanish navies to establish the British Empire as the dominant world power — the 'empire on which the sun never sets' — influencing many aspects of life in numerous countries across the world, even today. Due to this historical prominence, although many other navies have similar designations, only the United Kingdom's is referred to as 'The Royal Navy' without further qualification. The Royal Navy pioneered many advances in naval technology and strategy: the construction of HMS Dreadnought, whose revolutionary design so shocked the world that battleships for a time became generically labelled as 'dreadnought' or 'pre-dreadnought'; the first battlecruisers; the world's first carrier-launched, all-aircraft attack at the Battle of Taranto; anti-submarine warfare advancements such as sonar, high-frequency direction finding, hydrophones, depth charges, and the 'Hedgehog' anti-submarine mortar; and innovations to aircraft carrier designs such as concentrating the bridge and flight control tower into one island superstructure (as opposed to a flush deck configuration), steam catapults and ski-jump ramps for launching aircraft, and full-length, armored, and angled flight decks. Up to and during the First World War, the Germans attempted to challenge the might of the Royal Navy, only to be blockaded and stymied by the latter's superior tactics (drawn from centuries of experience) and numbers; however, the effectiveness of Germany's U-boats on unescorted shipping taught the British important lessons in convoy tactics - a lesson which the Americans would soon learn upon their entry into the Second World War. Although World War I severely depleted the British and consequently the Royal Navy, it was still a formidable force, and after the London and Washington Naval Treaties were no longer being observed by the other nations in 1938, it set about rapidly re-arming itself to reaffirm its place as the most powerful navy in the world. This did not come by easily however, as it suffered heavy losses in the opening stages of World War II with the sinking of HMS Courageous, HMS Glorious, and HMS Hood in the Atlantic, and HMS Hermes, HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales in the Pacific. Nevertheless, the Royal Navy's resilience won through, playing a major part in Operations Dynamo, Husky, Torch, Avalanche, and Overlord; the guarding of supply lines that enabled the British and her allies to fight in all theaters of the War; the British Pacific Fleet distinguished herself in every engagement she was involved in, despite facing various logistical and political difficulties; the systematic cornering and sinking of the Kriegsmarine's powerful battleships and battlecruisers; the seizing of many Enigma-related codebooks and machines; and the near-annihilation of the U-boat fleet in the Battle of the Atlantic. Both World Wars greatly taxed the British Empire, and her decline led to the Royal Navy handing the reins over to the US Navy as the most powerful navy in the world.",
  "_wiki_nation_germany_description": "Throughout most of European history, Germany's naval prowess had always been eclipsed by its British, French, Dutch and Spanish neighbors. A unified Germany only came into being in the late 19th century, thus it did not play a major role in the European colonial period; while its inherited coastline (largely from the Kingdom of Prussia) was relatively long, Germany's geographical location at the center of the European continent meant that greater preference was given to its army and its navy never went beyond being a coastal defense force. Beginning in the late 19th century, Kaiser Wilhelm II pursued a policy of naval strengthening, believing that a powerful navy was the key to power on the world stage and possibly also wishing to compete with his cousin, King George V of Britain. While the meteoric rise of the Imperial German Navy caught the attention of Europe and brought about a costly naval arms race, it was never able to out-build and out-innovate the Royal Navy, who responded with powerful and revolutionary designs such as HMS Dreadnought and the Queen Elizabeth-class battleships. Nevertheless, the Imperial German Navy was a formidable force in World War I, being the first navy in the world to display the crippling effectiveness of submarines (despite technological limitations) against unescorted merchant shipping and slow, sluggish warships. After her defeat, Germany once again set about attempting to challenge the Royal Navy with 'Plan Z', but the earlier-than-expected outbreak of World War II meant that it could not be fully implemented, leaving her navy — now known as the Kriegsmarine — severely under-equipped to go toe-to-toe with the Royal Navy. This caused her surface fleet to be mostly relegated to operations support (such as Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway and Denmark) and commerce raiding. However, the Kriegsmarine had powerful (but very few) battleships and battlecruisers, scoring victories in sinking HMS Hood and HMS Glorious and putting up valiant, stubborn resistance — a testament to the crews' tenacity — until the superior numbers of British forces wore them down. As in World War I, more feared than her surface combatants were her fleet of U-boats; the largest, most powerful in the world and under the command of Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz — an experienced submariner himself who was instrumental in the buildup of the U-boat fleet after the scrapping of 'Plan Z' — they wreaked havoc on British and American fleets and supply lines, sinking 14 million tons of shipping and more enemy warships than any other class throughout the war. Eventually, mounting losses inflicted by the Royal Navy resulted in the Kriegsmarine's surrender along with Germany on 8 May 1945, Victory in Europe (V-E) Day.",
  "_wiki_nation_netherlands_description": "The colorful beginnings of the first independent Dutch navy are as unique as the empire it would eventually be tasked to protect. Originally a series of private charters defending the interests of the various merchants, trading guilds and local authorities, it would eventually coalesce into a unified fighting force in the Eighty Years War, fighting for their independence from Spanish rule. Despite being one of the earliest European colonial empires, the Dutch Empire that followed after was far more interested in commerce rather than territorial expansion - a holdover from its mercantile origins - and as such rarely bothered themselves with taking inland territories, and their standing navy was small compared to that of other empires. Nevertheless, the 17th century saw the Dutch navy being at the zenith of its power, ushering in the Dutch golden age and being the only European power that was allowed to trade with Japan during her period of isolation (or “sakoku”). In the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch war, the Dutch managed to gain great victories on the British and the French, mostly lead by the legendary admiral De Ruyter. The 18th century onwards, however, saw their fortunes take a turn for the worse; the failure to take the Philippines from the Spanish, Macau from the Portuguese, and the Fourth Anglo-Dutch war that ultimately led to the British breaking the back of the Dutch Navy at the Battle of Camperdown. Renamed to the Royal Netherlands Navy (Koninklijke Marine) in 1905, the Great Depression hit Dutch commerce particularly hard, and the resulting budget cuts left the navy severely underfunded and underequipped. While the Netherlands managed to remain neutral in World War I, doing so again in World War II would prove to be futile, with Germany sweeping through the Dutch homeland in a week on 10 May 1940, giving the Kriegsmarine crucial submarine snorkel technology (known as the snuiver). Fortunately, most of the Dutch fleet was located in the Dutch East Indies (present day Indonesia), protecting the resource-rich archipelago, but that would eventually come under attack by the Japanese on 8 December 1941. Although aggressive use of their small flotilla of submarines dealt an initial heavy blow to the Japanese, the Dutch Navy would once again have its back broken in the Battle of the Java Sea on 27 February 1942.",
  "_wiki_nation_italy_description": "With the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 AD, the Italian peninsula would not be united for over a thousand years until the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. Out of this unification was born the Italian Royal Navy, known as the Regia Marina. Situated in the very center of the Mediterranean, the newly established Regia Marina attempted to claim the Mediterranean Sea as Mare Nostrum (literally 'Our Sea'), constantly vying for supremacy against France, The United Kingdom, and Austria-Hungary, keeping the Regia Marina at the forefront of Italian politics. Unfortunately, they were hampered from the very beginning by a serious lack of cohesion and uniformity in their officers and equipment, pitiful naval budgets resulting in poor infrastructure and facilities with which to support the navy, and rapidly advancing technologies that the divided naval schools of Italy couldnt keep up with. The navies of Austria-Hungary and Italy eventually spent most of World War I keeping each other at bay in their respective harbors, with the notable exceptions of the latter's MAS motorboats (mezzi d'assalto, or torpedo armed motorboats) and the first working prototypes of miniature single-torpedo armed submarines — dubbed 'human torpedoes' — employed to sink two Austro-Hungarian battleships late in the War. During the interwar period, the Regia Marina was once again pressured by the changing global political situation to choose a proper design doctrine for their warships. Concluding that the French would be their most likely adversaries, they emphasized speed and long-range gunnery, and set about modernizing their older World War I dreadnoughts, building the Littorio-class battleships and a wide variety of destroyers, submarines and cruisers, including the Zara-class: the best-protected heavy cruisers ever built until they were surpassed almost 20 years later by the U.S. Navy's Des Moines class. Entering World War II with the fourth largest navy in the world, the Regia Marina nevertheless struggled against the French and British navies for dominance over the Mediterranean. While having long gun ranges and excellent fire control systems, a near total disregard for radar and sonar technology consigned the Regia Marina to a “fair weather fleet”, relying on visual sighting of targets and making overcast days and night battles incredibly disadvantageous. Greatly aware of their inability to replace losses, naval commanders were forced to confer with headquarters for virtually any engagement, wasting precious time and failing to press even the clearest of decisive advantages. Reasoning that they would only operate in the Mediterranean Sea near the Italian Peninsula, no resources were allocated to the development of naval aviation. Despite this, the Regia Marina had a reputation for having well-designed ships and well-trained seamen, showing their defiance after the Battle of Taranto by heavily damaging the battleships HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Valiant, and fighting on against the Royal Navy — a highly experienced foe with overwhelmingly superior numerical and technological advantage — doggedly holding onto the Mediterranean for three long years until the Armistice of 1943. As the country split in two, so did the Regia Marina; some ships would join the Italian Co-Belligerent navy, fighting for the allies, while others would become part of the National Republican Navy of the Italian Social Republic in the north. Both of these faction's navies would fight against each other until World War II ended in 1945. The birth of the Republic of Italy in June 1946 saw the Regia Marina re-title itself as the Marina Militare (Military Navy); the following year, Italy was forced to divest nearly all of her surviving naval forces as part of the formal peace process with the victors of World War II. The threat of the Soviet Union, though, quickly pushed the western European powers and the United States into ensuring that Italy had the tools and ability to defend herself, particularly after the new republic became one of the founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949. As a part of the new alliance, the primary concern of the Marina Militare became littoral control of the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian Seas. Today, the Italian Navy operates modern vessels of nearly every type, from aircraft carriers Cavour and Giuseppe Garibaldi all the way down to diesel-powered attack submarines and coastal patrol boats.",
  "_wiki_nation_france_description": "'Honor, Homeland, Valor, Discipline.' These are still the four tenets that define the Marine Nationale — or 'La Royale' — as one of the world's oldest navies. The Marine Nationale was instrumental in establishing the French colonial empire and engaging in near-constant conflicts with their European neighbors, particularly the Royal Navy. Despite constantly being dwarfed in overall size by their closest rival, the well-funded and well-equipped Marine Nationale still had an outsized influence on world events and naval strategy, being deeply involved in the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century, the modernizing efforts of the Imperial Japanese Navy in the 19th century, negotiating the various post-World War I naval treaties early in the 20th century, and developing the Jeune École naval theory. Its engineers and shipbuilders were among the best in the world, building the Le Fantasque class of destroyers — the world's fastest to this day — and while the French paid little heed to naval aviation, their focus on battleships, especially fast battleships, produced the Dunkerque and Richelieu classes, regarded as among the most successful designs built under the displacement limits of the Washington Naval Treaty. Largely spared from the deep military budget cuts brought about by the Treaty of Versailles during the interwar period, the Marine Nationale took part in the Battle of the Atlantic, Operation Weserübung, and Operation Dynamo at the onset of the Second World War. However, the signing of the Armistice of 22 June 1940 with Germany meant that all operations with the Allies had to be suspended under the new Vichy France client state, with the exception of those who were able to join the Free French Naval Forces. While the terms of the Armistice meant that France was officially neutral, the British did not want to risk having the most powerful vessels of the Marine Nationale fall into enemy hands. Thus, the Royal Navy was directed to execute Operation Catapult, an attack on the French naval forces docked at Mers-el-Kébir, Algeria, on 3 July 1940, greatly souring relations between the two powers for years to come. Nevertheless, rather than allow them to be captured by the Germans as part of Case Anton, French sailors scuttled the remainder of their fleet in Toulon on 27 November 1942, retaining their honor till the very end.",
  "_wiki_nation_commonwealth_description": "The 'Commonwealth of Nations' was born in the early twentieth century during the waning years of the British Empire. Officially formed in December 1931 via the Statute of Westminster, the original seven member states were the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, and Newfoundland. Today, it is made up of 52 sovereign states that span the globe, and currently includes nations that had no previous political or economic ties to the United Kingdom or the British Empire. Several of the various nation-states that comprise the Commonwealth deploy their own military forces. Collectively, they are represented in World of Warships under a single flag, but each navy has its own history and traditions.",
  "_wiki_nation_spain_description": "The Armada Española (Spanish Navy) was the most powerful maritime force in the world from the 16th century to the end of the 18th century. In the early 19th century, with the loss of most of its empire, Spain transitioned to a smaller fleet but maintained a shipbuilding industry which produced important technical innovations. The Spanish Navy built and operated one of the first military submarines, made important contributions in the development of the destroyer, and again achieved a first global circumnavigation, this time by an ironclad vessel. In 1898, the Spanish-American War broke out and the Spanish Navy saw crushing defeats at the hands of the United States. The war end with the collapse of the Spanish Empire. After the war, Spain rebuilt their fleet into a smaller, but modern force. Spain would remain neutral throughout World War I. In the 1930's, the Spanish Navy was divided by the Spanish Civil War and numerous engagements between the Republicans and Nationalists were recorded with significant losses for both sides. Spain remained neutral in World War II, but the navy continued to conduct patrols. Spain acquired many vessels from the United States in the post-war years, including their first aircraft carrier and brought the Spanish Navy back into a position of being one of the most powerful and capable European navies. Today the Spanish Navy remains a significant force capable of projecting power within its sphere of influence and abroad. Its shipbuilding industry is one of the best in the world, building many ships for itself and foreign navies. The main bases of the Spanish Navy are at Rota, Ferrol, San Fernando and Cartagena.",
  "_wiki_nation_pan_america_description": "The Pan-American faction does not cover a specific nation, but includes ships from several Central and South American countries. Currently, these South American navies are represented in World of Warships: the Argentine Republic, the Federative Republic of the Brazil, the Republic of Chile, the Republic of Colombia, the Republic of Peru and the United Mexican States. In the game, each ship can hoist its respective navy's individual ensign (as shown below) or the Pan-American flag (as shown on the left).",
  "_wiki_type_Cruiser_description": "Larger than destroyers yet smaller than battleships, cruisers have fulfilled as many roles as they had designations; common ones include 'light', 'heavy', 'protected', 'armored', 'torpedo', and later, 'missile' cruisers. Cruisers are often called upon to hunt down enemy destroyers, perform quick response duties, escort and protect merchant shipping or larger vessels like battleships and aircraft carriers from various threats, provide an additional layer of defense... whatever needs to be done at any given moment.",
  "_wiki_type_Battleship_description": "Battleships have traditionally been the flagships of a given nation's navy, originating from the Age of Sail's ships-of-the-line, to World War I's dreadnoughts, to modern day battleships sporting longer ranges, higher speeds, and advanced equipment. Incredibly expensive, with massive firepower and protection (and equally manpower-intensive), they were used as a projection of power and a major component of military and diplomatic strategy, creating arms races and being a focal point of naval treaties. However, their practical purpose was often questioned; their deployments were few and far between due to their costs and the low (depending on opinion) risk-return; they were vulnerable to smaller, cheaper vessels and weapons; limited by range and accuracy, naval artillery were being increasingly supplanted by aircraft in the long-range ordinance delivery role, arguably the actual role of the battleship. Sidelined into fire support roles and with the development of long-range missiles, battleships were slowly and completely phased out in favor of aircraft carriers.",
  "_wiki_type_Destroyer_description": "Small, light, and unassuming, destroyers may not be the most durable of ships, but all of them are well capable of punching many times above their weight through a deadly mix of speed, maneuverability, stealth and astounding firepower. Destroyers are versatile ships which can use either their rapid fire guns to chip away at enemies or their torpedoes to cause devastating damage. Destroyers are often called upon to scout out enemy positions, provide support — either with a smoke screen or as a distraction — and/or perform precise strikes on individual targets.",
  "_wiki_type_AirCarrier_description": "Aircraft carriers are basically floating airbases, transporting, servicing, launching planes into combat and recovering them, providing readily available air support to the naval fleets under their charge. While they can project power virtually anywhere on the battlefield, carriers are incredibly vulnerable when enemies have penetrated or circled your team's defenses, with no player-controlled guns and only AI-controlled secondaries to defend themselves.",
  "_wiki_type_Submarine_description": "Submarines are stealthy vessels that can submerge to avoid attacks and radar detection, resurfacing unexpectedly to deal massive damage. Armed with high-damage torpedoes and light turrets, they excel at ambushing enemies but are vulnerable to surface fire when exposed.",
